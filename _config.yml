  Iâ€™m a student majoring in Computer Science building my pool of knowledge. 
  <br><br>
  I work part time as an automotive technician while also attending school part time.  I don't have much free time between those, so what time I do have is spent enjoying myself however I can.  My hobbies include enjoying anime, reading, and baking.
